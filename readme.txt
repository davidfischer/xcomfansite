http://www.iquest.net/~rclark/ClarkWehyr.html.  Snip the indicated text and
run it through CRICKET to validate the fingerprints.

If you'd rather not use my utility, note that PKZIP and ARJ (and possibly
other archivers as well) also use the CRC-32 algorithm.  Just view the
archive listing.


INSTALLATION:
=============
Extract the above files into any directory in your PATH.  Or you could use
the enclosed INSTALL.BAT file, which will copy these files into the first
directory in your PATH.

Type XCOMEDIT /? or TFTDEDIT /? at the command line prompt for usage
parameters.  Please see the "Configuration" section of the documentation
for further details.

The CWXCED.DOC file is the Microsoft Word 97 version of the documentation.
CWXCED.TXT is an ASCII text version of the same file.  If you can view
MS Word 97 files, you would probably prefer to use CWXCED.DOC.
